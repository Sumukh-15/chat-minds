# chat-minds
This is the core application script of ChatMinds, a privacy-respecting, local LLM-powered chatbot built with Streamlit, LangChain, and Ollama. It offers a modern web UI, chat history, and user login/logout features â€” all running fully on your machine without relying on paid APIs like OpenAI.
